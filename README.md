# ASLAlphabetRecognitionApplication

Simple React Native application to recognize ASL Alphabets on a mobile device

I used this model found on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/danrasband/classifying-images-of-the-asl-alphabet-using-keras/

As the author mentioned in their post, the model overfitted the training dataset so does not perform well on a real dataset. In any case, this project helped me learn some react native (expo) and other Javascript libraries.
